# JPEG Tomogram Conversion Script

Pack and unpack 3D MRC files to JPEG stacks for visualization to save space. This tool is intended for visualization and annotation of cryoET tomograms, which may be useful locally and for sending to collaborators for faster visual analysis.

## Warning
This tool should not be used for downstream processing as the JPEG format causes a loss in precision.

## Requirements
This script requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:
- mrcfile
- numpy
- Pillow

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install mrcfile numpy Pillow
```

## Usage

You can use this script to pack or unpack single files or entire directories. Here are some examples:

To pack a single MRC file into a JPEG stack:
```
./jpeg_tomogram.py pack tomogram.mrc
```

To pack a directory of MRC files into JPEG stacks:
```
./jpeg_tomogram.py pack tomograms/
```

To unpack a single JPEG stack into a MRC file:
```
./jpeg_tomogram.py unpack tomogram.jpgs
```

To unpack a directory of JPEG stacks into MRC files:
```
./jpeg_tomogram.py unpack tomograms/
```

## Options

This script supports several optional arguments:

- `-o`, `--output_path`: Specify the output file or directory. By default, the output will be saved in the same location as the input.
- `-e`, `--external_viewer`: Specify an external program to open the unpacked MRC file.
- `-q`, `--quality`: Specify the quality of the JPEG images in the stack. The default quality is 80, and values above 95 should be avoided.
- `-c`, `--cores`: Specify the number of CPU cores to use. By default, the script will use all available cores.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Enable verbose output.

## Example with Options

Here is an example of using the script with some optional arguments:

```
./jpeg_tomogram.py pack tomogram.mrc -o output_directory/ -q 90 -c 4 -v
```

## Author

This script was written by Alex J. Noble with assistance from OpenAI's GPT-4 model, July 2023.

In this example, the script will pack the `tomogram.mrc` file into a JPEG stack with a quality of 90. The output will be saved in `output_directory/`. The script will use 4 CPU cores, and verbose output will be enabled.
